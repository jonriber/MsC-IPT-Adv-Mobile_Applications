## APP STRUCTURE

GOOD MOBILE APPS REQUIRES PROPER PLANNING AND STRATEGIC DESIGN
* USER EXPERIENCE
* NETWORK BANDWIDTH
* NAVIGATION STRATEGY
* DEVIDE BEING USED

### NETWORK BANDWIDTH

WE DO NOT CONTROL NETWORK BANDWIDTH\
USERS CAN DOWNLOAD OUR APP AND USE IT WHEREVER THEY WANT TO\
APP CONTENT MUST BE LIGHTWEIGHT

### NAVIGATION STRATEGY

NAVIGATION IS ONE OF THE FIRST INTERACTIONS THAT USERS MIGHT HAVE WITH YOUR APP\
SO, MAKE IT AS ENJOYABLE AS POSSIBLE.

* POOR NAVIGATION DESIGN ANNOYS USERS
* GOOD NAVIGATION HELPS USERS TO USE INTUITIVELY ALL FEATURES
* EFFICIENT ARCHTECTURE MINIMIZES FRUSTATION
* INTUITIVE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES POSITIONING~
* CREATIE LOGICAL SEQUENCE

### DEVICE BEING USED

* NOT EVERYONE HAS THE LATEST MODELS
* APP SHOULD BE USED ON A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT DEVICES AND SCREENS
* WATCH OUT FOR DP (DENSITY POINTS) UNLESS THAN PX (PIXELS)

## MOBILE APP ARCHTECTURE

PRINCIPLES TO REMENBER

* KISS
* DRY
* CLEAN
* SOLID

### KISS

_KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID!_

DESIGN PRINCIPLE OBSERVED BY USA IN 1960\
MOST SYSTEMS WORK BETTER IF KEPT SIMPLE RATHER THAN COMPLICATED\
SIMPLICITY SHOULD BE A KEY DESIGN GOAL.

### DRY

DON´T REPEAT YOURSELFE!

EVERY PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE OR LOGIC MUST HAVE A SINGLE REPRESENTATION WITHIN A \
SYSTEM.

### CLEAN

SOFTWARE DEVELOPED IN LAYERS

ADVANTAGES:

* TESTABLE
  * BUSINESS RULES CAN BE TESTED WITHOUT THE USER INTERFACE, DATABASE, SERVER OR ANY OTHER EXTERNAL ELEMENTS.
* USER INTERFACE INDEPENDENT: CAN CHANGE EASILY WITHOUT CHANGING REST OF THE SYSTEM
* DATABASE INDEPENDENT
* INDEPENDENT OF ANY EXTERNAL AGENT

### SOLID

FIRST FIVE OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN

EACH CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE SINGLE TASK.

* SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
  * SHOULD NEVER BE MORE THAN ONE REASON FOR A CLASS TO CHANGE
* OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE
  * SOFTWARE ENTITIES SHOULD BE OPEN FOR EXTENSION
* LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
* INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE
  * CLIENT SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO DEPEND UPON INTERFACES THEY DO NOT USE
* DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE
  *DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS

## MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT CYCLE

* STRATEGY
* PLANNING
* DESIGN
* DEVELOPMENT
* TESTING
* DEPLOYMENT

### STRATEGY

SMALL DOCUMENT THAT CONTAINS A BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT YOUR APP,\
REQUIREMENTS, TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS, IT´S PURPOSE AND IT DOES.

### PLANNING

DIVIDE TO CONQUER

SPLIT A BIG TASK INTO SMALL SUB-TASKS.

### DESIGN

CREATE MOCK-UPS. THIS MEANS CREATING GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF YOUR APP, HOW\
IT WILL LOOK LIKE, THEMES, COLORS, ETC.

SOME TOOLS EVEN ACCEPT INSERTION OF FUNCTIONALITIES AND ANIMATIONS, WHICH MEANS BEHAVIORAL\
EXPECTTAION.

### DEVELOPMENT

CODING TIME

### TESTING

SOMETIMES WE WANT TO TEST EVEN BEFORE DEVELOPMENT. THIS APROACH IS CALLED TDD.

BUT USUALLY, AFTER CODING TIME, WE MUST TEST OUR CODE AGAINST TYPICAL BEHAVIOR AND EDGE CASES.

## ANDROID APP STRUCTURE

THE SAME APP USES DIFFERENT LAYOUTS FOR DIFFERENT SCREEN SIZES.

### SIZES

PIXEL DENSITY IS THE NUMBER OF PIXELS WITHIN A PHYSICAL AREA. IT IS REFERRED TO AS \
DPI (DENSITY PER INCH)

UNITIES

* PX(PIXELS)
  * ACTUAL PIXELS ON THE SCREEN
* IN(INCHES)
  * BASED ON THE PHYSICAL 

THIS SEMESTER, WE ARE USING TWO SIZE UNITIES.

DP OR DIP - AN ABSTRACT UNIT THAT IS BASED ON THE PHYSICAL DENSITY OF THE SCREEN

THESE UNITS ARE RELATIVE TO A 160 DPI SCREEN

RATIO OF DP-TO-PIXEL WILL CHANGE WITH THE SCREEN DENSITY

SP(SCALABLE PIXELS OR SCALE-INDEPENDENT PIXELS) - LIKE DP UNIT, BUT ALSO\
SCALED BY THE USER´S FONT SIZE PREFERENCE.

WINDOW SIZE = USE DP UNIT

TEXT SIZE = USE SP UNIT
