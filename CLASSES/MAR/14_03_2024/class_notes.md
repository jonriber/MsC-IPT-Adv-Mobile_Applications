# MARCH 14, 2024 - CLASS NOTES

## KOTLIN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

WHEN PROGRAMMING WITH KOTLIN, WE MUST KNOW THAT EVERY CLASS IS PUBLIC BY DEFAULT.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GOOD PROGRAMMER AND AN EXCELENT PROGRAMMER ARE THE DETAILS AND\
YOUR COMMNENTS.

Kotlin observations

* val is used as a constant
* var is similar to the let declarition in js, which value can be replaced
* we can use the reserved keyword it, as this
* When possible, avoid to use bp images. Instead use svg files
  * Svg´s are light weight
  * faster
  * scale up and down
* Android 7 supports Svg images, android 5 doesn´t. 
* When we don´t have svg support, android converts svg images into png files.
* Drawable folder inside res folder contais images, like app icons

## Show CV app

## Dice Roller app

The main purpose to this project is:

* Ask users to select a random image inside range 1-6
* Then, find the correspondent dice image according the selected number
* Render this svg image
