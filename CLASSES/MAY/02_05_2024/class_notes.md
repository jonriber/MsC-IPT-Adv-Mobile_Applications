## FINAL PROJECT PLANNER

SO, I AM APPROACHING MY FINAL PROJECT ASSIGMENT, AND NOW I AM SUPPOSED TO GET INTO EXECUTION PATH./
I HAVE A 10 STEPS INITIAL PLAN WHICH I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT, TECHNICALLY./

- PROJECT SETUP
  - SETTING UP MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
  - INSTALL `ANDROID STUDIO`
  - PROJECT STRUCTURE AND DEPENDENCIES

  - LAYOUTS, LOGIN PAGES AND CONTENT PAGES
- LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTATION
  - CONNECTION BETWEEN UI ELEMENTS AND KOTLIN CODE
- API INTEGRATION
  - ENDPOINTS DEFINITION
  - NETWORK CALLS IMPLEMENTATION  USING `RETROFIT` OR `VOLLEY`
- CONTENT PAGES
- TESTING AND DEBBUGING
- SECURITY AND ERROR HANDLING
- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- DEPLOYMENT
- POST-DEPLOYMENT

## KOTLIN DEVELOPMENT GOOD PRACTICES

LOOK OUT THROUGH YOUR CODE, THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A HARD CODED TEXT.

WHEREVER YOU NEED TO DISPLAY SOME TEXT INSIDE YOUR APPLICATION, YOU SHOULD PLACE YOUR TEXT IN A RESOURCE FILE.

THERE IS A POINTER TO EACH ID IN OUT PROJECT, MAKING IT EASIER TO FIND TEXT.

THE MAIN IDEA IS:

- IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR APP, OR EVEN TRANSLATE IT TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE, ONE WOULD JUST UPDATE A SINGLE FILE.
- SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUE.
