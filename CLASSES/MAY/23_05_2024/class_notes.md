# MAY, 23, 2024 - MOBILE DEVELOPMENT - GOOGLE PLAY STORE

## Google play

Google play console: <https://play.google.com/console>

Google demands developers keep their hosted apps updated, so the app itself might keep visible on the google
play store.

### Creating an application

Hit the button `create application`

Choose a `suggestive name`

Pick an app `category`

Pay attention to legal declaration:

- developer program agreement
- User data

Define people who will be interacting with your app

### Submitting your app on an online store

WARNING!!!!

Plan yourself with extra time, due to the fact that submiting your app to a store is not fast.

So, one might upload your app package in time, but configuring it on the store is not that simple.

For real apps, It might be even more time consuming and a lot more bureaucracy.

Google needs to run health checks, check for deployment requisites and security.

### Testing 

Testing is essential to ensure its proper functioning.

There are 3 options available:

- Closed testing: users picked by hand
- Open testing: warning is set, users know that the app might be faulty at some point.
- Production: App is real, it works perfectly and it was extensively tested through different scenarios and
conditions.


### App presentation on the store

We need a 512 X 512 image to upload to the store.

This works for app presentation purposes.

Attentions that this is not your app logo, which is defined inside source code.

You must also choose a category. There are a few options available, pick one that suits the best for your app.

### Privacy policy

Information about your app data consumption, how it handles it and what it needs to access.

User must know your app purpose and how far it goes when privacy is on the table.

Developers must tell the truth and be honest about it.

It only makes your app legit.

## App visible on the online store

There are a lot of questions that development team must answer to make your app visible.

And it only turns visible once all questions are answered.


## Practical session

The mais purpose for this practice section is to render an map app.

steps to create an app:

- add gradle resources and dependencies
